# Daily Memories
Take a trip down memory lane with pictures from the current month and day in previous years as found in your iCloud Photos.

# Objective
Started during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, this project set out to achieve the following goals:

* Replace a certain social media site's ability to surface fond memories from the current month and day for surprise and delight
* Learn SwiftUI and Combine
* Build code for macOS using Catalyst

As it grew, it also served as a purpose to learn additional skills:

* iOS 14+ widgets
* Local Notifications
* How to use SFSymbols

Future Goals:
* Improve UI and UX (I'm no graphic designer!)
* Learn how to leverage tests (XCTest and XCUITest) to insure quality in the app
